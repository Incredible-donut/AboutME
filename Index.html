  <h2>8th of March</h2>
<p>International Women's Day (IWD) is celebrated
 on the 8th of March every year around the world.
 It is a focal point in the movement for women's rights.
 After the Socialist Party of America organized a Women's
Day in New York City on February 28, 1909, German delegates Clara Zetkin,
KÃ¤te Duncker and others proposed at the 1910 International Socialist Woman's
Conference that "a special Women's Day" be organized annually.
After women gained suffrage in Soviet Russia in 1917, March 8 became a
national holiday there. The day was then predominantly
celebrated by the socialist movement and communist countries until it was
adopted by the feminist movement in about 1967. The United Nations began
celebrating the day in 1977.</p>
